# MusicFestivalApplication
This application reads from a comma delimited file creating 6 different stages and multiple bands to be placed in observable lists. It begins by displaying a home view with a button for each stage. Clicking a button changes the view to a stage view and displays the bands currently in a stages observable list. The stage view contains functionality to move a band up or down the list or relocate a band to another stage. The state of each stage is saved if a band is moved up or down a list or moved to another stage.
